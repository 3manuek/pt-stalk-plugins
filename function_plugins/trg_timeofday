# Check load avg. Prints 1 if it is equal or greater than the threshold 
# Usage: --function trg_timeofday --threshold start
# example threshold: 20140402173751 
# this will match when the system time is equal to or greater than 17:37:51 on April 2 2014.  
# so you should combine with --run-time, --iterations and --sleep to get the desired number of total captures. 
# The idea is to use this trigger when a problem consistently happens at a specific time, but the
# load based triggers aren't fast enough to catch the problem
